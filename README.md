# patterns

This is a pattern catalog for describing the design patterns in Java. The project is maintained and edited using IntelliJ.
We welcome you to edit and share your way of using the design patterns.

## Instructions for adding your own variation of a design pattern

Every design pattern ( for example Abstract Factory) has a package. Inside this package, there is a package for each variation.
So you can define your own variation of Abstract Factory by defining a package inside the 'abstractfactory' package.

When you define a package, also define a client outside of the package to showcase how a client would invoke/interact
with the design pattern.
